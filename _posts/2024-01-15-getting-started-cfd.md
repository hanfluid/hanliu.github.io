## What is CFD?

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is the use of numerical analysis and algorithms to solve and analyze problems involving fluid flows. With the advancement of computing power, CFD has become an indispensable tool in both academic research and industrial applications.

## Key Methods

There are several fundamental approaches in CFD:

- **Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)**: Resolves all scales of turbulence without any modeling. Extremely expensive computationally but provides the most accurate results.
- **Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)**: Resolves large-scale turbulent structures while modeling the smaller scales. A good balance between accuracy and computational cost.
- **Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)**: Models all turbulent scales. Most computationally affordable but less accurate for complex flows.

## Getting Started

If you're new to CFD, here are some resources I recommend:

1. Start with the fundamentals of fluid mechanics (e.g., Kundu & Cohen's textbook)
2. Learn a programming language (Python or Fortran/C++)
3. Get familiar with open-source CFD tools like OpenFOAM
4. Practice with simple canonical flows (channel flow, cavity flow)
