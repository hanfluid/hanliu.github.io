I earned both my B.S. and Ph.D. in Fluid Mechanics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), and I am currently a researcher at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I build CFD solvers from scratch, and I find that genuinely exciting.

There is something deeply satisfying about writing every line of a flow solver yourself: discretizing the Navier-Stokes equations, implementing the time integration, debugging the pressure Poisson solver at 2 a.m., and finally watching a physically correct vortex emerge on screen. That hands-on, from-the-ground-up approach has defined my work from the start.

I began by writing **compressible flow solvers** for shock-turbulence interaction and Richtmyer-Meshkov instability, where getting the numerics right at the smallest scales of energy transfer is everything. From there I built **multiphase solvers**, coupling level set and volume-of-fluid methods to track the chaotic dynamics of air, water, and oil simultaneously. These in-house codes have let me tackle problems I care about: [ventilated supercavitation](/visualizations/#ventilated-cavity-flow), [oil dispersion under breaking waves](/visualizations/#oil-dispersion-under-breaking-waves), [airborne virus transmission in restaurants](/visualizations/#covid-19-airborne-transmission), and [turbulent canopy flows](/visualizations/#turbulent-canopy-flow) with flexible vegetation.

What drives me now is **optimization**: making solvers faster, leaner, and smarter. I'm exploring **quantum-inspired algorithms and tensor network methods** to compress and solve the Navier-Stokes equations, seeking exponential speedups that classical approaches cannot offer. The idea of encoding an entire turbulent flow field as a matrix product state, then evolving it efficiently, feels like the next frontier.

If it involves fluid physics, numerical methods, and the challenge of squeezing every ounce of performance out of a computation, I'm in.
