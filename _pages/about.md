Hi, I am Han Liu, a researcher at [St. Anthony Falls Laboratory](https://cse.umn.edu/safl), University of Minnesota. Before joining UMN, I obtained my Ph.D. in Fluid Mechanics from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2018.

My research interests are focused on **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**, including:

- **Multiphase flow** — air-water-oil systems, ventilated cavitation
- **Turbulence** — compressible turbulence, large-eddy simulation
- **Particle-laden flow** — preferential concentration, Stokes number effects
- **Fluid-structure interaction (FSI)** — flexible aquatic canopies, hydrokinetic turbines
- **Flow instability** — Richtmyer-Meshkov instability, mixing
- **Data-driven methods** — variational quantum algorithms for fluid mechanics

I develop high-fidelity numerical simulation tools and apply them to problems ranging from fundamental turbulence physics to practical engineering applications such as COVID-19 airborne transmission, oil spill dynamics in breaking waves, and renewable energy systems.
