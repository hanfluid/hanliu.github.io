    B.S. and Ph.D. from Peking University. Now a researcher at [Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory](https://www.safl.umn.edu/), University of Minnesota.

    I write in-house computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers from the ground up: discretization, parallel computing (MPI, CUDA), CPU/GPU optimization. I know what every line of my code does (before AI agents...).

    My work focuses on multiphase turbulence, both incompressible and compressible, using VOF, level set, CLSVOF, phase-field, immersed boundary method, and particle methods. Applications span [ventilated supercavitation](/visualizations/#ventilated-cavity-flow), [oil spills under breaking waves](/visualizations/#oil-dispersion-under-breaking-waves), [COVID-19 airborne transmission](/visualizations/#covid-19-airborne-transmission), [canopy flows](/visualizations/#turbulent-canopy-flow), [Richtmyer-Meshkov instability](/visualizations/#richtmyer-meshkov-instability), and particle-laden turbulence.

    Now I'm pushing CFD into its next generation by combining quantum computing, AI, and high-performance computing. I'm exploring quantum tensor networks for solving the Navier-Stokes equations. I also orchestrate multiple AI coding agents to develop and debug solvers. Sometimes they fix bugs while I sleep. The goal is next-gen CFD: fundamentally faster, scalable, smarter, and true digital twin.
