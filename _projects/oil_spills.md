We perform high-fidelity numerical simulations to investigate the bubble, water droplet, and oil droplet generated by impingement of breaking waves on an oil slick. The flow field in the air-oil-water system is obtained by solving incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a coupled level set method.

This research provides critical insights for understanding oil spill dispersion in ocean environments and supporting environmental protection efforts.
